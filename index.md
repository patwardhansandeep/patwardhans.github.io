These products are developed using <b>Lightning Aura Components, Apex including scheduled class, batch classes, queueable classes, triggers</b>. Some complex queries are developed to create dashboards and amazing features. I also manage Package processes like creating, releasing, submitting for security reviews and fixing security review issues of managed packages. There is a smaller package which helps Customers migrate from D&B Optimizer to D&B Connect which I have developed.

Before joining Dun & Bradstreet, I was employed with <a href="https://cloudaction.com/">Cloudaction Inc.</a> working as a Senior Salesforce Consultant.
